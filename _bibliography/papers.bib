  abstract    = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a devastating X-linked disorder caused by dystrophin gene mutations. Despite recent advances in understanding the disease etiology and applying emerging treatment methodologies, glucocorticoid derivatives remain the only general therapeutic option that can slow disease development. However, the precise molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid action remains unclear, and there is still need for additional remedies to complement the treatment. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptome analyses of human and mouse muscles, we investigated pathogenic features in patients with DMD and palliative effects of glucocorticoids. Our approach further illuminated the importance of proliferating satellite cells and revealed increased activity of a signal transduction pathway involving EZH2 in the patient cells. Subsequent administration of EZH2 inhibitors to Dmd mutant mice resulted in improved muscle phenotype through maintaining the immune-suppressing effect but overriding the muscle weakness and fibrogenic effects exerted by glucocorticoids. Our analysis reveals pathogenic mechanisms that can be readily targeted by extant therapeutic options for DMD. Genome-wide survey of human and mouse DMD tissues suggests EZH2’s role in satellite cells; its inhibition improves prognosis.}

abstract = {Natural products (NPs), a fundamental class of bioactive molecules with broad applicability, are valuable sources in pharmaceutical research and drug discovery. Despite their significance, the large-scale production of NPs is often limited by their availability and scalability, requiring alternative approaches such as metabolic engineering or biosynthesis. To identify ideal pathways for the mass production of NPs, deep learning-based retrosynthesis models have been recently developed. Such models accelerate NP discovery; however, these tools are often not easy to use for researchers with a limited computational background, because they require complex environment configurations, command-line interfaces, and substantial computational resources. Here, we introduce READRetro web, a user-friendly web platform that integrates the READRetro machine learning (ML) model for retrosynthesis prediction. Based on modern web technologies, our web platform provides a fast and responsive user experience. READRetro Web bridges the gap between advanced ML-driven retrosynthesis and practical research workflows, making retrosynthesis prediction accessible to a broader range of researchers. Our platform demonstrates high predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, offering well-organized results to facilitate NP retrosynthetic pathway design. READRetro Web is freely accessible via https://readretro.net.}

abstract = {Plants, as a sessile organism, produce various secondary metabolites to interact with the environment. These chemicals have fascinated the plant science community because of their ecological significance and notable biological activity. However, predicting the complete biosynthetic pathways from target molecules to metabolic building blocks remains a challenge. Here, we propose retrieval-augmented dual-view retrosynthesis (READRetro) as a practical bio-retrosynthesis tool to predict the biosynthetic pathways of plant natural products. Conventional bio-retrosynthesis models have been limited in their ability to predict biosynthetic pathways for natural products. READRetro was optimized for the prediction of complex metabolic pathways by incorporating cutting-edge deep learning architectures, an ensemble approach, and two retrievers. Evaluation of single- and multi-step retrosynthesis showed that each component of READRetro significantly improved its ability to predict biosynthetic pathways. READRetro was also able to propose the known pathways of secondary metabolites such as monoterpene indole alkaloids and the unknown pathway of menisdaurilide, demonstrating its applicability to real-world bio-retrosynthesis of plant natural products. For researchers interested in the biosynthesis and production of secondary metabolites, a user-friendly website (https://readretro.net) and the open-source code of READRetro have been made available.},

    abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
