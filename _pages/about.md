**안녕하세요!** (that's Korean for “Hi!” 👋)  
I’m **Yejin Kwak**, a computational biology researcher with a passion for understanding complex cellular systems through single-cell and spatial omics technologies.

I completed my B.S. and M.S. at [Pusan National University](https://www.pusan.ac.kr/eng/Main.do), where I joined the [Computational Omics Laboratory](https://pnucolab.com). I now work there as an associated researcher, focusing on `bioinformatics`, `spatial biology` and `machine learning`.

My main research interests include `spatial omics`, `gene regulation`, and the `computational tools` that help us make sense of them. I especially enjoy developing methods and workflows that bridge the gap between raw data and biological insight.

Outside of research, you’ll often find me organizing scientific workshops, exploring cafés, dancing to anything with a beat, singing a little too enthusiastically, or sketching ideas for research tools that don’t yet exist.

**Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate, talk about science, or just say hi! ✨**
